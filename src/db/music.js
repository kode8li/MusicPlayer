    [Intro]
    I just want to make this clear (Listen)
    I am a believer
    But sometimes it gets hard (Listen)
    My name is Dax (Dear God)
    
    [Verse 1]
    Dear God
    There's a lot of questions that I have about the past (Can you hear me?)
    And I don't want hear it from a human, you made it
    So you're the last person that I'm ever gonna ask
    Tell me what's real, tell me what's fake
    Why is everything about you a debate? (Why?)
    What's the point of love?
    Every time I've showed it I was broken and it's forced me just to only wanna hate
    Why's there only one you but multiple religions? (Why?)
    Why does every conversation end in a division? (Why?)
    Why does everybody want to tell us how to live
    But they won't listen to the same damn message that they givin'? (Fuck them)
    Tell me how to feel, tell me what's wrong
    I tried to call, pick up the phone (Pick up)
    I'm on my own
    Everybody said you comin' back, then man why the hell's it takin' so long?
    
    [Verse 2]
    Why do I hurt? (Why?) Why is there pain?
    Why does everything good always have to change? (Why)
    Why does everybody try to profit off another man's work
    Then destroy it just for monetary gain?
    Tell me are you black or are you white?
    I don't even really care I just really want to know what's right (I don't care)
    They been sayin' one thing but I've been lookin' in the book
    And it seems like they've been lyin' for my whole damn life
    Tell me where I'm goin' (Where?) Is it heaven or hell?
    I just hope this message greets you well
    Had a dream that I was walkin' with the devil, don't remember how it feels
    But I swear that I remember the smell
    Looked me right into my eye and told me everything I wanted could be mine
    If I gave up and decided to sell
    But I said I'd rather die then get mine, now I'm here
    No fear, one man with a story to tell

    [Verse 3]
    Dear God, where were you when I needed it? When I fucked up and repeated it?
    When they set the bar and I exceeded it? (Where were you?)
    My life is like a book that they've been judgin' by a cover
    But have never took the time to fuckin' read the shit (Fuck)
    I remember tellin' you my goals and my dreams
    But you didn't even answer, so I guess you didn't believe in it
    I remember sittin' with a gun to my head tryna ask you for some help
    But I guess you didn't believe in it
    I don't want religion, I need that spirituality
    I don't want a church, I need people to call a family
    I don't wanna tell my sins to another sinner
    Just because he's got a robe and he went to some academy
    I don't wanna read it in a book, I wanna hear it from you
    Don't wanna learn it in my school because they hidin' the truth (Swear)
    Don't wanna talk about it to another fuckin' human being
    And that's only reason that I even stepped in this booth
    
    [Verse 4]
    Dear God
    How do I take this darkness and turn it into light? (Talk to me)
    How do believe in a concept where I speak to a man
    I've never seen with my own two eyes? (How?)
    How do I know that religion wasn't made
    Just to separate the world and create a whole disguise
    Just to keep us in these chains while the rich get richer
    And the poor pray to you and perpetuate a lie?
    How do I know this ain't some big joke? (How?)
    How can I have faith when there is no hope? (How?)
    How the hell does one man have 100 billion dollars
    And we still have people on the street that are broke?
    There's a lot of things I wanna talk about and get off my chest
    I can't sleep 'cause the devil won't let me rest
    I used to know a fuckin' pastor in a church
    And I can still hear the screams of the kids he would fuckin' molest

    [Verse 5]
    Dear God
    Do you hear me? (Do you hear me?)
    I'm supposed to fear you but you ain't said shit
    So maybe it's you who actually fears me?
    I don't know the answer, I just want to see it clearly
    So many lies there's a 1000 different theories
    All I want to know is who really made religion
    'Cause I know it wasn't you but don't nobody believe me
    No more lies, no more death
    Bring back King, bring back X
    Please dear God let their souls rest
    Protect who's left and watch their steps
    Dear God (Dear God)
    I don't want to have to ask you again
    I just hope that you know that I'm still a believer
    So I'll end this all by sayin' amen

    The quiet's driving me insane
    Silence rattles in my brain
    Yeah, I gotta get away (Yeah, I gotta get away)
    Always waiting for the fall
    So I built my towers tall
    Wandering through these empty halls

    Walls are coming down

    This emptinеss, it hurts like hell
    My good intentions lеt me down (Down, down, down)
    I keep getting in my way
    My stubborn pride will dig my grave
    Leave behind with every step I take, yeah
